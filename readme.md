# nvim-kickstart

This repository provides my Neovim (NVIM) configurations, designed to enhance your coding experience. It's configured primarily for **Python**, **JavaScript (JS)**, **TypeScript (TS)**, and **Vue**, but can be extended to support other languages according to your preferences.

Many commands and configurations are inspired by VS Code, making the transition and usage more user-friendly.

**Note:** This setup is tailored for Linux (Ubuntu).
